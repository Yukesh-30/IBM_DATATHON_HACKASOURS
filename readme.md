# 🍱 Food Demand Forecasting using XGBoost  
### *IBM Datathon Hackasours — Predicting Daily Food Demand for Smart Kitchens*


---

## 📘 Overview

This project implements a **Machine Learning–powered forecasting system** that predicts **daily food demand (units sold)** for multiple restaurant outlets.  
It is designed to help **large-scale kitchens and welfare canteens (like Amma Unavagams)** make **data-driven decisions** for food preparation, procurement, and distribution.

By accurately forecasting demand, the system aims to:

- Reduce **food wastage** 🥦  
- Prevent **shortages** 🍛  
- Optimize **inventory and procurement** 🧾  

The pipeline integrates **XGBoost** within a **Scikit-learn pipeline**, ensuring modularity, reproducibility, and safety against data leakage.
